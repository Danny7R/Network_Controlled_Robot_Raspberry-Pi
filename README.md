# Network_Controlled_Robot_Raspberry-Pi
This repo focuses on building an explorer robot using a Raspberry Pi 3. The robot has a camera and is remotely controlled through a web UI (while connected to the same wireless network), with the live video from the camera being streamed in real time.

coded in:
1. Python: main app and programs
2. HTML: web UI
3. Bash: starting and stoping the camera and the streaming process
