# Network-Controlled Robot using a Raspberry-Pi 3
This repo focuses on building an explorer robot using a Raspberry Pi 3. The robot has a camera and is remotely controlled through a web UI (while connected to the same wireless network), with the live video from the camera being streamed in real time.

**Coded in:**
1. *Python:* main app and programs
2. *HTML:* web UI
3. *Bash:* starting and stoping the camera and the streaming process
